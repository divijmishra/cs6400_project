# Fetching data

To fetch data, navigate to the project's home directory and run

```
python3 data/get_data.py
```

This will download the raw data from the source, extract it, and create subsets with 100, 1k, 10k, and 100k subsets, respectively.

[later: update details about the dataset here, if helpful]
